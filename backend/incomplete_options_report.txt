Tiger beetles are such fast runners that they can capture virtually any nonflying insect.  However, when running  toward an insect, the beetles intermittently stop, and then, a moment later, resume their attack.  Perhaps they cannot maintain their pace and must pause for a moment's rest; but an alternative hypothesis is that while running tiger beetles are unable to process the resulting rapidly changing visual information, and so quickly go blind and stop. Which of the following, if discovered in experiments using artificially moved prey insects, would support one of the two hypotheses and undermine the other?

During the past year, Pro.Tect Insurance Company's total payout on car.theft claims has been larger than the  company can afford to sustain.  Pro-Tect cannot reduce the number of car-theft policies it carries, so it cannot protect itself against continued large payouts that way.  Therefore, Pro.Tect has decided to offer  a  discount  to  holders  of  car.theft  policies  whose  cars  have  antitheft  devices.    Many  policyholders  will respond  to  the  discount  by  installing  such  devices,  since  the  amount  of  the  discount  will  within  two  years typically more than cover the cost of installation.  Thus, because cars with antitheft devices are rarely stolen, Pro-Tect's plan is likely to reduce its annual payouts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Herbicides allow cereal crops to be grown very efficiently, with virtually no competition from weeds.  In Britain,  partridge  populations  have  been  steadily  decreasing  since  herbicide  use  became  widespread.    Some environmentalists claim that these birds, which live in and around cereal crop fields, are being poisoned by the herbicides.  However, tests show no more than trace quantities of herbicides in partridges on herbicide.treated land.  Therefore, something other than herbicide use must be responsible for the population decrease. Which of the following, if true about Britain, most seriously weakens the argument?

--------------------------------------------------------------------
A product that represents a clear technological advance over competing products can generally command a  high price. Because technological advances tend to be quickly surpassed and companies want to make large profits while they still can, many companies charge the maximum possible price for such a product.  But large profits on the new product will give competitors a strong incentive to quickly match the  new  product's  capabilities.   Consequently,  the  strategy  to  maximize  overall  profit  from  a  new product is to charge less than the greatest possible price. In the argument above, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?

Question 57 (ID: 6805c4e077d692898d947de3):
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Paleontologist: About 2.8 million years ago, many species that lived near the ocean floor suffered substantial  population declines.  These declines coincided with the onset of an ice age.  The notion that cold killed those bottom.dwelling  creatures  outright  is  misguided,  however;  temperatures  near  the  ocean  floor  would  have changed  very  little.   Nevertheless,  the  cold  probably  did  cause  the  population  declines,  though indirectly.    Many  bottom.dwellers  depended  for  food  on  plankton,  small  organisms  that  lived  close  to  the surface  and  sank  to  the  bottom  when  they  died.   Most  probably,  the  plankton  suffered  a  severe population  decline  as  a  result  of  sharply  lower  temperatures  at  the  surface,  depriving  many bottom-dwellers of food.

Question 72 (ID: 6805c4e077d692898d947dfe):
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Bank depositors in the United States are all financially protected against bank failure because the government  insures all individuals' bank deposits.  An economist argues that this insurance is partly responsible for the high rate of bank failures, since it removes from depositors any financial incentive to find out whether the bank that holds their money is secure against failure.  If depositors were more selective, then banks would need to be secure  in  order  to  compete  for  depositors'  money. Which  of  the  following,  if  true,  most  seriously weakens the economist's argument?

Options:
A. A. Before the government started to insure depositors against bank failure, there was a lower rate of bank failure

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Excavations of the Roman city of Sepphoris have uncovered numerous detailed mosaics  depicting  several  readily  identifiable  animal  species:  a  hare,  a  partridge,  and  various Mediterranean fish. Oddly, most of the species represented did not live in the Sepphoris region when  these  mosaics were  created.  Since  identical  motifs  appear  in  mosaics  found  in other Roman cities, however, the mosaics of Sepphoris were very likely created by traveling artisans from some other part of the Roman Empire.

The higher the level of certain vitamins and minerals in the bloodstream, the better a person's  lungs function, as measured by the amount of air the person can expel in one second. The lung function of smokers is significantly worse, on average, than that of nonsmokers. Clearly, therefore, one way for smokers to improve their lung function is for them to increase their intake of foods that are rich in these helpful vitamins and minerals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
A product that represents a clear technological advance over competing products can generally  command a high price. Because technological advances tend to be quickly surpassed and companies want to make large profits while they still can, many companies charge the greatest price the market will bear when they have such a product. But large profits on the new  product  will  give  competitors  a  strong  incentive  to  quickly  match  the  new product’s  capabilities. Consequently,  the  strategy  to  maximize  overall  profit  from  a  new product is to charge less than the greatest possible price. In the argument above, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?

Critics of the hospital have concluded that the uninsured patients are mot receiving proper medical care. However, this conclusion is almost certainly false.

Environmental  organizations  want  to  preserve  the  land  surrounding  the  Wilgrinn  Wilderness  Area  from  residential  development.  They  plan  to  do  this  by purchasing that land from the farmers who own it. That plan is ill.conceived: if the farmers did sell their land, they would sell it to the highest bidder, and developers would outbid any other bidders.  On  the  other  hand, these  farmers  will  never  actually  sell  any  of  the  land, provided that farming it remains viable. But farming will not remain viable if the farms are  left  unmodernized,  and  most  of  the  farmers  lack  the  financial  resources  modernization requires. And that is exactly why a more sensible preservation strategy would be to assist the farmers to modernize their farms to the extent needed to maintain viability.

Question 100 (ID: 6805c4e077d692898d947e33):
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Historian:  In  the  Drindian  Empire,  censuses  were  conducted  annually  to  determine  the  population of each village. Village census records for the last half of the 1600’s are remarkably complete. This very completeness makes one point stand out; in five different years, villages overwhelmingly reported significant population declines. Tellingly, each of those five  years  immediately  followed  an  increase  in  a  certain  Drindian  tax.  This  tax,  which  was assessed  on  villages,  was  computed  by  the  central  government  using  the  annual  census figures. Obviously, whenever the tax went up, villages had an especially powerful economic incentive  to  minimize  the  number  of  people  they  recorded;  and  concealing  the  size  of  a village’s  population  from  government  census  takers would  have been  easy.  Therefore,  it  is reasonable  to  think  that the  reported  declines  did  not  happen. In  the  historian’s argument, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?

Historian: Newton developed mathematical concepts and techniques that are fundamental to  modern  calculus.  Leibniz  developed  closely  analogous  concepts  and  techniques.  It  has traditionally  been  thought  that  these  discoveries  were  independent.  Researchers  have, however,  recently  discovered  notes  of  Leibniz’  that  discuss  one  of  Newton’s  books  on mathematics.  Several  scholars  have  argued  that  since  the  book  includes  a  presentation  of Newton’s  calculus  concepts  and  techniques,  and since  the  notes  were  written  before Leibniz’ own development of calculus concepts and techniques, it is virtually certain that the traditional view is false. A more cautious conclusion than this is called for, however. Leibniz’ notes are limited to early sections of Newton’s book, sections that precede the ones in which Newton’s calculus concepts and techniques are presented.

Criminologist:  Some  legislators  advocate  mandating  a  sentence  of  life  in  prison  for  anyone who, having twice served sentences for serious crimes, is subsequently convicted of a third  serious  crime.  These  legislators  argue  that such  a  policy  would  reduce  crime dramatically, since it would take people with a proven tendency to commit crimes off the streets permanently. What this reasoning overlooks, however, is that people old enough to have served two prison sentences for serious crimes rarely commit more than one subsequent crime. Filling our prisons with such individuals would have exactly the opposite of the  desired  effect,  since  it  would  limit  our  ability  to  incarcerate  younger  criminals,  who commit a far greater proportion of serious crimes.

Editorial: An arrest made by a Midville police officer is provisional until the officer has  taken the suspect to the police station and the watch commander has officially approved the arrest.  Such  approval  is  denied  if  the  commander  judges  that  the  evidence  on  which  the provisional arrest is based is insufficient. A government efficiency expert has found that almost all  provisional  arrests  meet  standards  for  adequacy  of  evidence  that  watch  commanders enforce. The expert therefore recommends that the watch commander’s approval should no longer be required since the officers’ time spent obtaining approval is largely wasted. This  recommendation  should  be  rejected  as  dangerous,  however,  since  there  is  no assurance that the watch commanders’ standards will continue to be observed once approval is no longer required.

Question 106 (ID: 6805c4e077d692898d947e3a):

Business Consultant: Some corporations shun the use of executive titles because they  fear  that the  use  of  titles  indicating  position  in  the  corporation  tends  to  inhibit communication up and down the corporate hierarchy. Since an executive who uses a title is treated with more respect by outsiders, however, use of a title can facilitate an executive’s  dealings  with  external  businesses.  The  obvious  compromise  is  for  these executives to use their corporate titles externally but not internally, since even if it is widely known  that  the  corporation’s  executives  use  executive  titles  outside  their  organization,  this knowledge  does  not  by  itself  inhibit  communication within  the  corporation.

Scientists  typically  do  their  most  creative  work  before  the  age  of  forty.  It  is  commonly  thought  that  this  happens  because aging  by  itself  brings  about  a  loss  of  creative capacity. However, a study has found that almost all scientists who produce highly creative work beyond the age of forty entered their fields late and less than a dozen years before their creative  breakthroughs.  Since creative  breakthroughs  by  scientists  under  forty  also generally occur within a dozen years of the scientist’s entry into the field, the study’s finding strongly suggests that the real reason why scientists over forty rarely produce highly creative work is not due to age but rather because most have spent too long in their fields.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Ecologist: The Scottish Highlands were once the site of extensive forests, but these forests  have  mostly  disappeared  and  been  replaced  by  peat  bogs.  The  common  view  is  that  the Highlands’  deforestation  was  caused  by  human  activity,  especially  agriculture.  However, agriculture began in the Highlands less than 2,000 years ago. Peat bogs, which consist of compressed decayed vegetable matter, build up by only about one foot per 1,000 years and, throughout  the  Highlands,  remains  of  trees  in  peat bogs  are  almost  all  at depths great than four feet. Since climate changes that occurred between 7,000 and 4,000 years  ago  favored  the  development  of  peat  bogs  rather  than  the  survival  of  forests,  the deforestation was more likely the result of natural processes than of human activity. In the ecologist’s  argument  the  two  portions  in  boldface  play  which  of  the  following roles?

Question 109 (ID: 6805c4e077d692898d947e3d):
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Several of a certain bank’s top executives have recently been purchasing shares in  their own bank. This activity has occasioned some surprise, since it is widely believed that the  bank,  carrying  a  large  number  of  bad  loans,  is on  the  brink  of  collapse.  Since  the executives are well placed to know their bank’s true condition, it might seem that their share purchases show that the danger of collapse is exaggerated. However, the available information about the bank’s condition is from reliable and informed sources, and corporate executives do sometimes buy shares in their own company in a calculated attempt to calm worries about their company’s condition. On balance, therefore, it is likely that the executives of the bank are following this example. In the argument given, the two boldfaced portions play which of the following roles?

Aroca City currently funds its public schools through taxes on property. In place of this system,  the city plans to introduce a sales tax of three percent on all retail sales in the city. Critics protest that three percent of current retail sales falls short of the amount raised for schools by property taxes. The critics are correct on this point. Nevertheless, implementing the plan will probably not reduce the money going to Aroca’s schools. Several large retailers have selected Aroca City as the site for huge new stores, and these are certain to draw large numbers of shoppers from neighboring municipalities, where sales are taxed at rates of six percent  and  more.

As a large corporation in a small country, Hachnut wants its managers to have international  experience,  so each  year  it  sponsors  management  education  abroad  for  its management  trainees. Hachnut has found, however, that  the attrition rate of  graduates from this program is very high, with many of them leaving Hachnut to join competing firms soon after completing the program. Hachnut does use performance during the program as a criterion in deciding among candidates for  management positions, but both  this  function and the goal of providing international experience could be achieved in other ways.

Such  water  would  be useless  in  improving  physical performance, however, since the only way to get oxygen into the bloodstream so that it can be absorbed by the muscles is through the lungs.

Clearly,  corporations  should  adopt  the compromise  of  encouraging  their  executives  to  use  their  corporate  titles  externally  but  not internally, since even if it is widely known that the corporation’s executives use titles outside their  organization,  this  knowledge  does  not  by  itself  inhibit  communication  within  the corporation.

Question 115 (ID: 6805c4e077d692898d947e44):
--------------------------------------------------------------------
During the past year, Pro.Tect Insurance Company’s total payouts on car.theft claims were  larger than the company can afford to sustain. Pro-Tect cannot reduce the number of car-theft policies it carries, so cannot protect itself against continued large payouts that way.  Therefore, Pro-Tect  has  decided  to  offer  a  discount  to  holders  of  car-theft policies  whose  cars  have  antitheft  devices.  Many  policyholders  will  respond  to  the discount by installing antitheft devices, since the amount of the discount will within two years typically more than cover the cost of installation. Thus, because cars with antitheft devices are rarely stolen, Pro.Tect’s plan is likely to reduce its annual payouts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Many winemakers use cork stoppers; but cork stoppers can leak, crumble, or become moldy,  so  that  those  winemakers  must  often  discard  a  significant  proportion  of  their  inventory  of bottled wine. Bottlemaster plastic stoppers, which cannot leak, crumble, or mold, have long been available to winemakers, at a price slightly higher than that of traditional cork stoppers. Cork prices, however, are expected to rise dramatically in the near future. Clearly, therefore, winemakers who still use cork but wish to keep production costs from rising will be forced to reconsider plastic stoppers. And since the wine.buying public’s association of plastic stoppers with poor.quality wine is weakening, there is an excellent chance that the Bottlemaster plastic stopper will gain an increased share of the marked for wine- bottle  stoppers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Museums that house Renaissance oil paintings typically store them in environments that  are  carefully  kept  within  narrow  margins  of  temperature  and  humidity  to  inhibit  any deterioration. Laboratory tests have shown that the kind of oil paint used in these paintings actually adjusts to climatic changes quite well. If, as some museum directors believe, paint is the  most  sensitive  substance  in  these  works,  then  by  relaxing  the  standards  for temperature and humidity control, museums can reduce energy costs without risking damage to these paintings. Museums would be rash to relax those standards, however, since  results  of  preliminary  tests  indicate  that  gesso,  a  compound  routinely  used  by Renaissance  artists  to  help  paint  adhere  to  the  canvas,  is  unable  to  withstand  significant variations in humidity.

In  countries  where  automobile  insurance  includes  compensation  for  whiplash  injuries sustained in automobile accidents, reports of having suffered such injuries are twice as frequent as they are in countries where whiplash is not covered. Some commentators  have  argued,  correctly,  that  since  there  is  presently  no  objective  test  for whiplash, spurious  reports  of  whiplash  injuries  cannot  be  readily  identified.  These commentators are, however, wrong to draw the further conclusion that in the countries with the higher rates of reported whiplash injuries, half of the reported cases are spurious: clearly, in countries where automobile insurance does not include compensation for whiplash, people often have little incentive to report whiplash injuries that they actually have suffered.

Question 120 (ID: 6805c4e077d692898d947e4b):
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Editorial: An arrest made by a Midville police officer is provisional until the officer has  taken the suspect to the police station and the watch commander has officially approved the arrest.  Such  approval  is  denied  if  the  commander  judges  that  the  evidence  on  which  the provisional arrest is based is insufficient. A government efficiency expert has observed that almost all provisional arrests meet the standards for adequacy of evidence that the watch commanders enforce. The expert has therefore recommended that because the officers’  time  spent  obtaining  approval  is  largely wasted,  the  watch  commander’s approval  no  longer  be  required.  This  recommendation  should  be  rejected  as  dangerous, however, since there is no assurance that the watch commanders’ standards will continue to be observed once approval is no longer required.

Question 121 (ID: 6805c4e077d692898d947e4c):
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Paleontologist: About 2.8 million years ago, many species that lived near the ocean floor  suffered substantial population declines. These declines coincided with the onset of an ice age. The notion that cold killed those bottom.dwelling creatures outright is misguided, however; temperatures  near  the  ocean  floor  would  have  changed  very  little.  Nevertheless, the  cold probably did cause the population declines, though indirectly. Many bottom.dwellers depended for food on plankton, small organisms that lived close to the surface and sank to the bottom  when  they  died. Most  probably,  the  plankton  suffered  a  severe  population decline  as  a  result  of  sharply  lower  temperatures  at  the  surface,  depriving  many bottom.dwellers of food.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Plant scientists have used genetic engineering on seeds to produce crop plants that are highly  resistant to insect damage. Unfortunately, the seeds themselves are quite expensive, and the plants require more fertilizer  and water to grow well than normal  ones. Thus, for most farmers the savings on pesticides would not compensate for the higher seed costs and the cost of additional fertilizer. However, since consumer demand for grains, fruits, and vegetables grown without the use of pesticides continues to rise, the use of genetically engineered seeds of this kind is likely to become widespread.

Question 136 (ID: 6805c4e077d692898d947e62):
--------------------------------------------------------------------
In  a  certain  wildlife  park,  park  rangers  are  able  to  track  the  movements  of  many  rhinoceroses because those animals wear radio collars. When, as often happens, a collar slips off,  it  is  put  back  on.  Putting  a  collar  on  a  rhinoceros  involves  immobilizing  the  animal  by shooting it with a tranquilizer dart. Female rhinoceroses that have been frequently re.collared have  significant  lower  fertility  rate  than  un.collared  females.  Probably,  therefore,  some substances in the tranquilizer inhibit fertility. In  evaluating  the  argument,  it  would  be most useful to determine which of the following?

In the nation of Partoria, large trucks currently account for 6 percent of miles driven on  Partoria’s roads but are involved in 12 percent of all highway fatalities. The very largest trucks—those with three trailers—had less than a third of the accident rate of single.and double.trailer  trucks.  Clearly,  therefore,  one  way for  Partoria  to  reduce  highway  deaths would be to require shippers to increase their use of triple.trailer trucks.

Plankton  generally  thrive  in  areas  of  the  ocean  with  sufficient  concentrations  of  certain  nitrogen  compounds  near  the  surface,  where  plankton  live.  Nevertheless,  some  areas, though rich in these nitrogen compounds, have few plankton. These areas have particularly low  concentrations  of  iron,  and  oceanographers  hypothesize  that  this  shortage  of  iron prevents plankton from thriving. However, an experimental release of iron compounds into one  such  area  failed  to  produce  a  thriving  plankton  population,  even  though  local  iron concentrations increased immediately. Which of the following, if true, argues most strongly  against  concluding,  on  the  basis  of  the  information  above,  that  the oceanographers’ hypothesis is false?
