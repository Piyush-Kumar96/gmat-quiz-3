The disappearance of women as \nobjects  of  historical  studies  during  this  period  has \nelements of irony to it.  On the one hand, in writing \nabout  women,  earlier  historians  had  relied  not  on \nfirsthand sources but rather on secondary sources; the \nshift to more rigorous research methods required that \nsecondary  sources  be  disregarded.    On  the  other \nhand,  the  development  of  archival  research  and  the \ncritical  editing  of  collections  of  documents  began to \nreveal  significant  new  historical  evidence  concerning \nwomen,   yet   this   evidence   was   perceived   as \nsubstantially irrelevant:  historians saw political history \nas  the  general  framework  for  historical  writing.  \nBecause women were seen as belonging to the private \nrather  than  to  the  public  sphere,  the  discovery  of \ndocuments about them, or by them, did not, by itself, \nproduce  history  acknowledging  the  contributions  of \nwomen.  In  addition,  genres  such  as  biography  and \nmemoir,  those  forms  of  \"particular  history\"  that \nwomen had traditionally authored, fell into disrepute.  \nThe  dividing  line  between  \"particular  history\"  and \ngeneral  history  was  redefined  in  stronger  terms, \nwidening  the  gulf  between  amateur  and  professional \npractices of historical research.",

Although, as Drucker contends, TQM shares \nwith such systems the ultimate objective of increasing \nprofitability,  TQM  requires  fundamentally  different \nstrategies.    While  the  other  management  systems \nreferred  to  use  upper  management  decision\"making \nand  employee  specialization  to  maximize  shareholder \nprofits  over  the  short  term,  TQM  envisions  the \ninterests  of  employees,  shareholders,  and  customers \nas  convergent.    For  example,  lower  prices  not  only \nbenefit consumers but also enhance an organization's \ncompetitive  edge  and  ensure  its  continuance,  thus \nbenefiting employees and owners.  TQM's emphasis on \nshared  interests  is  reflected  in  the  decentralized \ndecision\"making,  integrated  production  activity,  and \nlateral  structure  of  organizations  that  achieve  the \nbenefits of TQM.",

    "passage": "In the 1980's, astronomer Bohdan Paczynski proposed \na way of determining whether the enormous dark halo \nconstituting  the  outermost  part  of  the  Milky  Way \ngalaxy  is  composed  of  MACHO's  (massive  compact \nhalo objects), which are astronomical objects too dim \nto  be  visible.    Paczynski  reasoned  that  if  MACHO's \nmake up this halo, a MACHO would occasionally drift in \nfront of a star in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a bright \ngalaxy near the Milky Way.  The gravity of a MACHO \nthat  had  so  drifted,  astronomers  agree,  would  cause \nthe star's light rays, which would otherwise diverge, to \nbend  together  so  that,  as  observed  from  Earth,  the \nstar  would  temporarily  appear  to  brighten,  a  process \nknown as microlensing.  Because many individual stars \nare   of   intrinsically   variable   brightness,   some \nastronomers  have  contended  that  the  brightening  of \nintrinsically  variable  stars  can  be  mistaken  for \nmicrolensing.    However,  whereas  the  different  colors \nof  light  emitted  by  an  intrinsically  variable  star are \naffected  differently  when  the  star  brightens,  all  of  a \nstar's  colors  are  equally  affected  by  microlensing.  \nThus, if a MACHO magnifies a star's red light tenfold, it \nwill  do  the  same  to  the  star's  blue  light  and  yellow \nlight.  Moreover, it is highly unlikely that a star in the \nLarge Magellanic Cloud will undergo microlensing more \nthan once, because the chance that a second MACHO \nwould  pass  in  front  of  exactly  the  same  star  is \nminuscule.",
