Village census records for the last half of the 1600’s are remarkably complete. This very completeness makes one point stand out; in five different years, villages overwhelmingly reported significant population declines. Tellingly, each of those five  years  immediately  followed  an  increase  in  a  certain  Drindian  tax.  This  tax,  which  was assessed  on  villages,  was  computed  by  the  central  government  using  the  annual  census figures. Obviously, whenever the tax went up, villages had an especially powerful economic incentive  to  minimize  the  number  of  people  they  recorded;  and  concealing  the  size  of  a village’s  population  from  government  census  takers would  have been  easy.

This activity has occasioned some surprise, since it is widely believed that the  bank,  carrying  a  large  number  of  bad  loans,  is on  the  brink  of  collapse.  Since  the executives are well placed to know their bank’s true condition, it might seem that their share purchases show that the danger of collapse is exaggerated. However, the available information about the bank’s condition is from reliable and informed sources, and corporate executives do sometimes buy shares in their own company in a calculated attempt to calm worries about their company’s condition. On balance, therefore, it is likely that the executives of the bank are following this example. In the argument given, the two boldfaced portions play which of the following roles?",

In place of this system,  the city plans to introduce a sales tax of three percent on all retail sales in the city. Critics protest that three percent of current retail sales falls short of the amount raised for schools by property taxes. The critics are correct on this point. Nevertheless, implementing the plan will probably not reduce the money going to Aroca’s schools. Several large retailers have selected Aroca City as the site for huge new stores, and these are certain to draw large numbers of shoppers from neighboring municipalities, where sales are taxed at rates of six percent  and  more.

    "questionText": "Plant scientists have used genetic engineering on seeds to produce crop plants that are highly  resistant to insect damage. Unfortunately, the seeds themselves are quite expensive, and the plants require more fertilizer  and water to grow well than normal  ones. Thus, for most farmers the savings on pesticides would not compensate for the higher seed costs and the cost of additional fertilizer. However, since consumer demand for grains, fruits, and vegetables grown without the use of pesticides continues to rise, the use of genetically engineered seeds of this kind is likely to become widespread. In the argument given, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?",
